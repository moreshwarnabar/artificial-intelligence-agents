# AI Coursework Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects developed as part of CSE-471 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence coursework. Each project focuses on a specific aspect of AI, including search algorithms, adverserial systems, logical agents, reinforcement learning, and probabilistic models.

## Projects

### 1. Search Algorithms Implementation

- **Description**: Implementation of various search algorithms to solve problems such as pathfinding in mazes.
- **Technologies Used**: Python

### 2. Multi-Agent Systems

- **Description**: Simulation of multi-agent systems to study interactions and optimize cooperative behavior and resource allocation.
- **Technologies Used**: Python

### 3. Logical Agent Development

- **Description**: Development of a logical reasoning agent that makes decisions based on predefined rules using propositional and first-order logic.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, MiniSAT

### 4. Reinforcement Learning Model

- **Description**: Creation of a reinforcement learning model to automate game playing, implementing Q-learning and SARSA algorithms.
- **Technologies Used**: Python

### 5. Probabilistic Models for Decision Making

- **Description**: Development of probabilistic models to aid decision-making under uncertainty, using Bayesian networks and Markov decision processes.
- **Technologies Used**: Python

## Installation

To run these projects, you will need Python and some specific libraries, depending on the project. Clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and install the required dependencies. Instructions to download MiniSAT can be found in the specification document for the logic agent.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-coursework-projects.git
cd ai-coursework-projects
```
